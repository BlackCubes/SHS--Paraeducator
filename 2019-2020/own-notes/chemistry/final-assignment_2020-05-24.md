### Balancing Chemical Equations

To balance chemical equations, you need to have equal numbers of the chemical substances on both sides of the equation. Here is a generic chemical equation where an arrow (or *yield*) is in the middle:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{A + B -> C}
\end{align*}
$$
The variables like $\ce{A}$ or $\ce{B}$ could be any type of chemical substance such as water $\ce{H2O}$, carbon dioxide $\ce{CO2}$, an organic compound such as vinegar $\ce{CH3COOH}$, or it could also have isotopes such as deuterium $\ce{^{2}H}$. The possibilities are almost endless. Physical states are sometimes shown as a lowercase letter with parenthesis around it such as liquid $\ce{(l)}$, solid $\ce{(s)}$, gas $\ce{(g)}$, or aqueous $\ce{(aq)}$. Lastly, energy could appear in the chemical equation from either the left side of right side as so: $\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + \pu{890 kJ}}$.

I know that this is a lot, but there are two more important things to talk about it which are **what type of arrows there are** and **what type of reactions there are**. Firstly, know that the left side of the arrow are called reactants while the right side of the arrow are called products. For **type of reactions**,  there is a ***single replacement*** reaction where one chemical substance ($\ce{C}$) that was together ($\ce{AC}$) switches to another chemical substance that was alone ($\ce{B}$) to form a new chemical compound ($\ce{BC}$) while leaving the other by itself ($\ce{A}$) such as this: $\ce{AC + B -> A + BC}$. There is also a ***double replacement*** reaction where one substance ($\ce{C}$) that was once together as a compound ($\ce{AC}$) swaps with another substance ($\ce{D}$) that was also once together with its former compound ($\ce{BD}$) to form two new compounds ($\ce{AD}$ and $\ce{BC}$) as shown: $\ce{AC + BD -> AD + BC}$. There is also a ***synthesis*** reaction that has two substances at the reactant side forming into one substance at the product side: $\ce{A + B -> C}$. Lastly, there is ***decomposition*** where there is one substance at the reactant side that splits off into two different substances at the product side: $\ce{C -> A + B}$.

For **types of arrow**, you could have the usual one $\ce{->}$ which means the the reaction is going in the forward direction, or a net forward reaction from reactants to products. There is also one where you have both arrows pointing in the opposite directions $\ce{<-->}$, or it could look like this $\ce{<=>}$. I won't go into details about these since they are advanced topics, but the one that is this $\ce{<=>}$ is used for equilibrium where the forward rate is equivalent to the reverse rate. At the university and career level in the workforce, self-studying this is important if you want to know more about equilibriums.

Finally, to the problem!

Let's say there is a problem and we needed to balance it:
$$
\ce{KBr + Fe(OH)3 -> KOH + FeBr3} \label{ChemEq1}
$$
On the reactants (left side) are potassium $\ce{K}$, bromide $\ce{Br}$, and iron $\ce{Fe}$ which are the same as the products (right side), but what about hydroxide $\ce{OH}$? The formula for it are the same as both sides since $\ce{O}$ is before $\ce{H}$ and they never leave each other? So, should it be considered as just $\ce{O}$ separate from $\ce{H}$? In this case, it is easier to have be as one compound as $\ce{OH}$ instead of two different substances separated from each other. Later, we'll delve with another problem regarding this issue.

Now, we need to count how many numbers does $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Br}$, $\ce{Fe}$, and $\ce{OH}$ have, and to know that is by looking at the subscripts which look like this: ${}_{2}$. If the compounds or substances do not have subscript numbers, then it is considered to be an invisible $1$. As you can see from ($\ref{ChemEq1}$) on the reactant side, $\ce{OH}$ has $3$. What this means is there are literally three of them. Still on the reactant side, $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Br}$, and $\ce{Fe}$ has only $1$ since there are no subscript numbers shown, but it is *invisible*; and this also literally means that each of them only has one. Here is a better visualization of the reactants (left side) of ($\ref{ChemEq1}$) with their charges:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{{ } \\ K^{1+}Br^{1-}} \quad \ce{OH^{1-}\\ Fe^{3+}OH^{1-}\\ OH^{1-}}
\end{align*}
$$
On the products side from ($\ref{ChemEq1}$), there is one $\ce{K}$, $\ce{OH}$, and $\ce{Fe}$, but there is only three $\ce{Br}$. Here is a visualization for it:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{{ } \\ K^{1+}OH^{1-}} \quad \ce{Br^{1-}\\ Fe^{3+}Br^{1-}\\ Br^{1-}}
\end{align*}
$$
The complete visualization of ($\ref{ChemEq1}$) looks like this:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{{ } \\ K^{1+}Br^{1-}} \quad \ce{{ } \\ +} \quad \ce{OH^{1-}\\ Fe^{3+}OH^{1-}\\ OH^{1-}} \quad \ce{{ } \\ ->} \quad \ce{{ } \\ K^{1+}OH^{1-}} \quad \ce{{ } \\ +} \quad \ce{Br^{1-}\\ Fe^{3+}Br^{1-}\\ Br^{1-}}
\end{align*}
$$
As you can see, there are unequal amounts of chemical substances on both the left and right side: $\ce{Br}$ has one at the left, but it has three on the right; $\ce{OH}$ has three on the left, but it has one on the right; and both $\ce{K}$ and $\ce{Fe}$ have an equal amount of one on both sides. This needs to be balanced. I'll use a table to tally how much chemical substances we need along with a visualization, but in your case it is probably best to stick with a table due to time constraints on tests and other class works/activities. But, if you need to use a visualization then do it.

| Substance | Reactant | Product |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| $\ce{K}$  | $1$      | $1$     |
| $\ce{Br}$ | $1$      | $3$     |
| $\ce{Fe}$ | $1$      | $1$     |
| $\ce{OH}$ | $3$      | $1$     |

Based on this table, both $\ce{K}$ and $\ce{Fe}$ are balanced: They have the same number on both sides. What is not balance are $\ce{Br}$ with $1$ on the left and $3$ on the right, and $\ce{OH}$ with $3$ on the left and $1$ on the right. Let's attack $\ce{Br}$: We cannot decrease the **Product** from $3$ to $1$ because there is no way to decrease of what we receive in the end. We could only *increase* that chemical substance. This is due to Entropy where basically things become more disorder as time increases. What we can do is ***increase*** the **Reactant** for $\ce{Br}$, but how do we do that? Simple, we multiply it, but why? That is because as you increase the chemical substance, you are also increasing its factor, and the factor is whatever number you are given. In this case, $\ce{Br}$ has a factor of $1$ in the **Reactant** side, and to increase from $1$ to $3$ is to increase its factor by 3: $1 \times 3 = 3$:

| Substance | Reactant                | Product |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| $\ce{K}$  | $1$                     | $1$     |
| $\ce{Br}$ | $1 \times 3 = \bold{3}$ | $3$     |
| $\ce{Fe}$ | $1$                     | $1$     |
| $\ce{OH}$ | $3$                     | $1$     |

If this is a little difficult to understand, then remember that multiplication is basically a shortcut to addition: Instead of adding all the numbers, we could multiply the factor which is the given value. For example, in $1$ hour is $60$ minutes. How many minutes are in $5$ hours? We need to change the given value, or ***factor***, of $60$ minutes by 5: $60 \times 5 = 300$. So, there are $300$ minutes in $5$ hours. We could have added instead: For $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5$ hours there are $60 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 300$ minutes. Which is easier to do: Multiplication or Addition? For numbers that are large, multiplication is easier and faster than adding them all together. For smaller numbers, addition could be easier. In this case, we used multiplication as a shortcut to balance $\ce{Br}$: For $3$ **Product**, we need $1 \times 3 = 3$ **Reactant** INSTEAD OF $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$ **Reactant**.

Let's continue with the Table Method: $\ce{Br}$ is now balanced with $3$ on both sides, but $\ce{OH}$ is not balanced with unequal numbers on both sides. Should we increase the **Reactant** or **Product**? As stated before, due to Entropy, there is no way to decrease the **Reactant** from $3$ to $1$, but we could increase the **Product** by multiplying the factor $1$ by $3$:

| Substance | Reactant                | Product                 |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| $\ce{K}$  | $1$                     | $1$                     |
| $\ce{Br}$ | $1 \times 3 = \bold{3}$ | $3$                     |
| $\ce{Fe}$ | $1$                     | $1$                     |
| $\ce{OH}$ | $3$                     | $1 \times 3 = \bold{3}$ |

Everything is now balanced, but lets look at it in a visual perspective:
