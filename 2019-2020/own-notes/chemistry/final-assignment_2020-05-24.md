### Balancing Chemical Equations

To balance chemical equations, you need to have equal numbers of the chemical substances on both sides of the equation. Here is a generic chemical equation where an arrow (or *yield*) is in the middle:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{A + B -> C}
\end{align*}
$$
The variables like $\ce{A}$ or $\ce{B}$ could be any type of chemical substance such as water $\ce{H2O}$, carbon dioxide $\ce{CO2}$, an organic compound such as vinegar $\ce{CH3COOH}$, or it could also have isotopes such as deuterium $\ce{^{2}H}$. The possibilities are almost endless. Physical states are sometimes shown as a lowercase letter with parenthesis around it such as liquid $\ce{(l)}$, solid $\ce{(s)}$, gas $\ce{(g)}$, or aqueous $\ce{(aq)}$. Lastly, energy could appear in the chemical equation from either the left side of right side as so: $\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + \pu{890 kJ}}$.

I know that this is a lot, but there are two more important things to talk about it which are **what type of arrows there are** and **what type of reactions there are**. Firstly, know that the left side of the arrow are called reactants while the right side of the arrow are called products. For **type of reactions**,  there is ***single replacement*** reaction which has two substances at the reactants side (left side) and it has one substance at the products side (right side): $\ce{AC + B -> A + BC}$. There is also ***double replacement*** reaction that has two substances at the reactants side and products side: $\ce{AC + BD -> AD + BC}$. There is also a ***synthesis*** reaction that has two substances at the reactant side forming into one substance at the product side: $\ce{A + B -> C}$. Lastly, there is ***decomposition*** where there is one substance at the reactant side that splits off into two different substances at the product side: $\ce{C -> A + B}$
