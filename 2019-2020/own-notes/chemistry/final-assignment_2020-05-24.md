### Balancing Chemical Equations

To balance chemical equations, you need to have equal numbers of the chemical substances on both sides of the equation. Here is a generic chemical equation where an arrow (or *yield*) is in the middle:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{A + B -> C}
\end{align*}
$$
The variables like $\ce{A}$ or $\ce{B}$ could be any type of chemical substance such as water $\ce{H2O}$, carbon dioxide $\ce{CO2}$, an organic compound such as vinegar $\ce{CH3COOH}$, or it could also have isotopes such as deuterium $\ce{^{2}H}$. The possibilities are almost endless. Physical states are sometimes shown as a lowercase letter with parenthesis around it such as liquid $\ce{(l)}$, solid $\ce{(s)}$, gas $\ce{(g)}$, or aqueous $\ce{(aq)}$. Lastly, energy could appear in the chemical equation from either the left side of right side as so: $\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + \pu{890 kJ}}$.

I know that this is a lot, but there are two more important things to talk about it which are **what type of arrows there are** and **what type of reactions there are**. Firstly, know that the left side of the arrow are called reactants while the right side of the arrow are called products. For **type of reactions**,  there is a ***single replacement*** reaction where one chemical substance ($\ce{C}$) that was together ($\ce{AC}$) switches to another chemical substance that was alone ($\ce{B}$) to form a new chemical compound ($\ce{BC}$) while leaving the other by itself ($\ce{A}$) such as this: $\ce{AC + B -> A + BC}$. There is also a ***double replacement*** reaction where one substance ($\ce{C}$) that was once together as a compound ($\ce{AC}$) swaps with another substance ($\ce{D}$) that was also once together with its former compound ($\ce{BD}$) to form two new compounds ($\ce{AD}$ and $\ce{BC}$) as shown: $\ce{AC + BD -> AD + BC}$. There is also a ***synthesis*** reaction that has two substances at the reactant side forming into one substance at the product side: $\ce{A + B -> C}$. Lastly, there is ***decomposition*** where there is one substance at the reactant side that splits off into two different substances at the product side: $\ce{C -> A + B}$.

For **types of arrow**, you could have the usual one $\ce{->}$ which means the the reaction is going in the forward direction, or a net forward reaction from reactants to products. There is also one where you have both arrows pointing in the opposite directions $\ce{<-->}$, or it could look like this $\ce{<=>}$. I won't go into details about these since they are advanced topics, but the one that is this $\ce{<=>}$ is used for equilibrium where the forward rate is equivalent to the reverse rate. At the university and career level in the workforce, self-studying this is important if you want to know more about equilibriums.

Finally, to the problem!

Let's say there is a problem and we needed to balance it:
$$
\ce{KBr + Fe(OH)3 -> KOH + FeBr3} \label{ChemEq1}
$$
On the reactants (left side) are potassium $\ce{K}$, bromide $\ce{Br}$, and iron $\ce{Fe}$ which are the same as the products (right side), but what about hydroxide $\ce{OH}$? The formula for it are the same as both sides since $\ce{O}$ is before $\ce{H}$ and they never leave each other? So, should it be considered as just $\ce{O}$ separate from $\ce{H}$? In this case, it is easier to have be as one compound as $\ce{OH}$ instead of two different substances separated from each other. Later, we'll delve with another problem regarding this issue.

Now, we need to count how many numbers does $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Br}$, $\ce{Fe}$, and $\ce{OH}$ have, and to know that is by looking at the subscripts which look like this: ${}_{2}$. If the compounds or substances do not have subscript numbers, then it is considered to be an invisible $1$. As you can see from ($\ref{ChemEq1}$) on the reactant side, $\ce{OH}$ has $3$. What this means is there are literally three of them. Still on the reactant side, $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Br}$, and $\ce{Fe}$ has only $1$ since there are no subscript numbers shown, but it is *invisible*; and this also literally means that each of them only has one. Here is a better visualization of the reactants (left side) of ($\ref{ChemEq1}$) with their charges:
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{{ } \\ K^{1+}Br^{1-}} \quad \ce{OH^{1-}\\ Fe^{3+}OH^{1-}\\ OH^{1-}}
\end{align*}
$$
